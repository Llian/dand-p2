# New York Subway turnstile data visualization

This Python program shows which subway stations are busy and where more
people depart or arrive for different times of the day. The data is based on
MTA turnstile data which is available [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).
The background map is based on [openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org)
data, rendered using [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net)
and [these rules](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Rotbarsch/Maperitive_rules/black_and_white)
that I've slightly adapted.

This project was part of my [Udacity nanodegree data analyst](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002)

Please note that I've manually created the animated gif from the png
files that the Python program generates.

## Feel free to fork this project and improve it

Just some suggestions:
* [ ] Automatic creation of the gif
* [ ] Better data basis by directly using MTA's data rather than the data
  provided here (which spans just a week).
